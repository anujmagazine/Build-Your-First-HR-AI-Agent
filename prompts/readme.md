# Scenario 13- Smart Salary Benchmarking

## Scenario

### The Context
Organisations in technology, fintech, SaaS, and product-led sectors regularly participate in external salary surveys and compensation benchmarking exercises. These benchmarks are increasingly used to justify hiring offers, band corrections, and appraisal outcomes to leadership and candidates. However, internal job titles and role definitions often do not align with market-standard roles.

### The Friction
Compensation teams pull data from Glassdoor, AmbitionBox, and levels.fyi, but each source uses different role definitions, company filters, and reporting logic. Different stakeholders often reference different sources, leading to confusion rather than clarity.

### The Problem
HR is required to defend a compensation decision for a role whose internal title does not map cleanly to the market. There is no reliable way to normalise titles, aggregate multi-source data, and arrive at a single, defensible market benchmark. As a result, offers get delayed, internal equity is questioned, and compensation decisions become difficult to justify.

## Prompt

### 1. Research Objective
Identify accurate external salary benchmarks for a role whose internal job title does not map cleanly to the market, and enable HR to defend a compensation decision during a hiring or appraisal cycle. Determine credible market compensation ranges for a Senior Product Manager equivalent role and assess how it should map to the internal title “Product Lead.”

### 2. Key Questions
- What is the market compensation range for a Senior Product Manager equivalent role in Mumbai and Bengaluru?
- How do compensation figures vary across Glassdoor, AmbitionBox, and levels.fyi?
- After role normalisation, what are the P50, P75, and P90 benchmarks?
- Which external role best maps to the internal title “Product Lead” based on role scope and seniority?

### 3. Research Methods
Aggregate compensation data from Glassdoor, AmbitionBox, and levels.fyi. Apply filters for:
- Location: Mumbai and Bengaluru
- Experience: 5 to 8 years
- Company context: Series B technology companies

Normalise roles based on responsibilities rather than job titles and cross-check findings across sources.

### 4. Evaluation Criteria
- Alignment of role scope and seniority
- Consistency across data sources
- Relevance of experience and location filters
- Confidence level of aggregated benchmarks

### 5. Expected Deliverables
- Short executive summary for HR leadership
- Consolidated salary view with P50, P75, and P90 ranges
- Explanation of role normalisation and mapping logic
- Notes on assumptions and confidence levels
- Direct source links

### 6. Constraints
- Use only public, verifiable data
- Treat compensation data as self-reported and potentially noisy
- Avoid conclusions based on a single source
- Do not include speculative interpretation
